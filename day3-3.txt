Data types in Javascript:

1.String :
      The string data type is used to represent textual data
 (i.e. sequences of characters). Strings are created using
 single or double quotes surrounding one or more
 characters.It represents textual data.

ex:  var a = 'Hi!';
        var d = 'welcome to js';

2.Number :
        The number data type is used to represent positive
 or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or 
numbers written using exponential notation.It contains
integer,float and complex numbers.
  
ex :  var a = 24;
         var b = 90.3;
          var c = 3.64e+8;

3.Boolean :
         The Boolean data type can hold only two values:
 true or false. It is typically used to store values like
 yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off (false), etc. 

ex :  var isReading = true;
         var isSleeping = false;

4.Undefined :
           The undefined data type can only have one
 value-the special value undefined. If a variable has
 been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has
 the value undefined.

ex :  var a;
         var b = "Hello World"
          alert(a)   //o/p:undefined
           alert(b) //o/p: Hello World

5.Null :
          It  is a special value that represents empty or 
unknown value.

ex :   let number = null;
